                Sachin Tendulkar, in full Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, (born April 24, 1973, Bombay [Mumbai], India), Indian
                professional cricket player, considered by many to be one of the greatest batsmen of all time.
                In 2012 he became the first cricketer to score 100 centuries (100 runs in a single innings) in
                international play.

                Tendulkar was given his first bat when he was 11 years of age. As a 14-year-old, he used it to score 329
                out of a world-record stand of 664 in a school match.
                A year later he scored a century on his first-class debut for Bombay (Mumbai), and at age 16 years 205
                days he became India’s youngest Test (international) cricketer, making his debut against Pakistan in
                Karachi in November 1989.
                When he was 18 he scored two centuries in Australia (148 in Sydney and 114 in Perth), and in 1994 he
                scored 179 against the West Indies.
                In August 1996, at age 23, Tendulkar was made captain of his country’s team.

        <h2>Sachin Tendulkar’s Early Life
            <hr>
        </h2>
        </br>
        <p>
            Tendulkar was born in Dadar, Bombay, at Nirmal Nursing Home in a Maharashtrian family.
            His father named Tendulkar after his favorite music director, Sachin Dev Buran, and he was trained under
            Ramakant Achrekar (reputed club cricketer at Shivajipark) during his school days.


            He studied at the Indian Education Society’s New English School in Bandra but on the advice of his coach, he
            shifted to Sharadashram Vidyamandir High school in Dadar, which was dominant for the cricket sport.
            A step from school cricket, he also played club cricket and later played for India’s Club Cricket.

            Later he trained in Chennai at the MRF Pace Foundation as a fast bowler, but on the advice of Dennis Lillee
            (he has taken 335 wickets in his Test career, which is a world record), he left fast bowling to concentrate
            on his batting abilities.
            After the recommendation of Dennis Lilee, he intensified his hard work on batting skills rather than fast
            bowling.
            He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian
            domestic tournaments.[53]
